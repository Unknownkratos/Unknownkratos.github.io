# Vash-Toro

## Introduction
The development of the number comparison game was an exciting project that showcased my proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This game allows two players to input numbers, after which the program compares the digits to identify commonalities and differences.

## Game Mechanics
In the game, the JavaScript code retrieves the input values from the players and then processes the digits to determine common and unique occurrences. This comparison is performed using nested loops and conditional statements to categorize the digits into "oro" and "vash" based on specific conditions.

## Frontend Development
The HTML and CSS components were utilized to create the user interface for the game. The HTML forms were designed to collect the players' input, while CSS was employed to enhance the visual presentation and user experience.

## JavaScript Implementation
The JavaScript code was responsible for handling the game logic. It included accessing the form elements, preventing default form submission, retrieving input values, resetting the form after submission, and performing the digit comparison and categorization.

## Challenges and Solutions
During the development process, I encountered challenges in handling the comparison logic and ensuring the game functioned as intended. However, through careful debugging and testing, these obstacles were overcome, contributing to an improved understanding of JavaScript programming.

## Conclusion
The successful creation of the number comparison game not only showcased my skills in front-end development and JavaScript programming but also provided valuable insights into problem-solving and logical thinking within the context of game development.
