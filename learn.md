- How to configure **`conf.py`** to customize layout, sidebar, and theme options
- How to apply and modify the **PyData Sphinx Theme** for a clean, professional look
- How to deploy a Sphinx-generated site using **GitHub Pages**

## Tools Used

- **Python** – base language for Sphinx
- **Sphinx** – site generator
- **PyData Sphinx Theme** – responsive and customizable theme
- **GitHub Pages** – static hosting platform
- **Markdown / reStructuredText** – for writing content
- **Virtual environments** – for managing Python dependencies


## Next Steps

- Add blog posts with MyST markdown
- Automate deployment using GitHub Actions
- Make the site multilingual or add dark mode
