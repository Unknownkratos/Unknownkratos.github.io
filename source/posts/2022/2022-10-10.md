# Wane - A 2D Pixel Art Adventure Game


This blog post illustrates the development of  Wane.


## Development Process
 the 2D pixel art adventure game Wane. Embark on an extraordinary journey as a fearless soldier, determined to protect the realm from menacing monsters lurking in the vast desert.


**Wane** was brought to life through the powerful Unity game engine and the magic of C# programming. As the sole developer of the game, I meticulously crafted each aspect of the gameplay, from character movement and combat mechanics to enemy AI and level design.

Utilizing Unity's versatile scripting capabilities, I programmed the soldier's movement, making sure every step felt fluid and responsive. I implemented a sophisticated combat system that allowed players to engage in thrilling swordplay with precise attacks and parries.

The captivating desert landscape in **Wane** was meticulously handcrafted using Photoshop. I drew inspiration from real desert terrain and infused it with fantastical elements to create an immersive and visually stunning world.

	if (activeEnemies. Count < maxEnemies && !isCoolingDown)
{
		// Randomly select a spawn point
		Transform spawnPoint = spawnPoints [Random.Range(0, 				spawnPoints.Length)];
		// Spawn the enemy at the selected spawn point
		GameObject enemy = Instantiate (enemyPrefab, spawnPoint.position, 		spawnPoint.rotation);
		// Add the enemy to the list of active enemies 					activeEnemies.Add(enemy);
		yield return new WaitForSeconds (spawnInterval);
