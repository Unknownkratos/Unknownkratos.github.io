# WalkThrough Wasalni(Android App)


## Beginning of the Journey
 Wasalni is an innovative mobile app that revolutionizes transportation in Ksibet el Mediouni, Monastir Region. Developed by a talented team, including me, this app aims to provide seamless and reliable ride-hailing services, connecting users with available taxis for hassle-free rides.


The creation of **Wasalni** was made possible by a highly skilled team of developers, including Me, JCI members, and two Turkish guests. Each team member brought their unique expertise to the project, ensuring a truly exceptional user experience.


The team leveraged cutting-edge technologies to build **Wasalni**:

- Frontend: Svelte and Framework7
- Backend: Svelte (JavaScript with minimal changes) with Axios for database interactions
- Database: Cockpit
- Map Integration: OpenStreetMap


Throughout the development process, the team collaborated seamlessly, brainstorming ideas, designing the user interface, and implementing robust functionalities. The frontend, crafted using Svelte and Framework7, guarantees a smooth and delightful mobile app experience, while the backend, built with Svelte, ensures efficient data processing and handling.




**Wasalni** harnesses the power of OpenStreetMap for real-time mapping, enabling users to locate nearby taxis and track their journey with ease. The backend, powered by Svelte and Axios, ensures a seamless connection with the database for swift retrieval of relevant ride and user data.



As the development nears completion, the team is eagerly preparing for the app's official launch. Rigorous testing is underway to deliver a bug-free and user-friendly experience.
