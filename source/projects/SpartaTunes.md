# WalkThrough ScreenSurf (Web App)

## Beginning of the Journey

*ScreenSurf* is a smart web-based movie recommendation app designed to help users discover what to watch based on their preferences. Built with a focus on user personalization, *ScreenSurf* delivers tailored movie suggestions using a sleek UI and real-time API integrations.

The development of **ScreenSurf** was a solo endeavor that combined frontend design, backend logic, and API communication into a unified experience. It aims to simplify the overwhelming task of choosing a movie by curating dynamic recommendations that evolve with the user's input.

The app was built using modern web technologies and clean architectural principles:

- **Frontend:** React with modern hooks and state management
- **Backend/API Layer:** Express.js & Axios for handling API requests
- **Database / Data Source:** Uses third-party movie APIs (e.g., DBMovies)
- **Authentication:** Token-based login system for saving user preferences
- **Features:** Favorites list, search filter, watch history, and mood-based suggestions

The interface was carefully designed to be responsive and intuitive. It includes a landing page, login/register pages, and a browsing area where users can filter by genre, rating, or mood. ScreenSurf not only delivers personalized content, but also remembers user activity across sessions for a more tailored experience.

**ScreenSurf** stands as a portfolio-ready app that demonstrates full-stack capabilitiesâ€”seamlessly integrating design, user authentication, and third-party data fetching.
