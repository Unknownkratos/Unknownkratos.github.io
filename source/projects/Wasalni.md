**Wasalni** is a mobile app designed to simplify and modernize transportation in Ksibet el Mediouni (Monastir region, Tunisia). As part of a dynamic, cross-cultural team including myself, two Turkish guests, and JCI members, we developed a complete ride-hailing platform — from idea to near-launch.

## Key Technologies

- Frontend: Svelte + Framework7  
- Backend: Svelte + Axios  
- Database: Cockpit CMS  
- Maps & Navigation: OpenStreetMap  

## My Role

- Implemented the ride flow (search → book → ride → rate)  
- Designed mobile UI screens in Svelte + Framework7  
- Integrated OpenStreetMap APIs for live taxi tracking  
- Built core backend API calls using Axios  
- Coordinated GitHub collaboration with team members

## Team Experience

Working with a culturally diverse team pushed us to think from multiple perspectives. Communication, UI/UX decisions, and even naming conventions were shared responsibilities.

We followed an agile, hands-on approach — fast prototyping, field testing, and real feedback from potential users in the region.
